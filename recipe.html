<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>Over medium heat, combine two cups of water and sugar, bringing to a boil until sugar is dissolved. Turn off of the heat and stir in agave nectar and lavender.</li>
<li>Allow mixture to steep for 2 hours (less if you want less of a lavender taste). Strain the liquid, pressing the lavender down to make sure you get all of those juices into your mixture!</li>
<li>In a large pitcher, combine freshly squeezed lemon juice, lavender mixture and water.</li>
<li>Feel free to add a couple drops of blue or purple food coloring if you want more color than the lavender provides. Makes the lemonade especially cute for those ladies√¢?? brunches! Serve over ice.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
